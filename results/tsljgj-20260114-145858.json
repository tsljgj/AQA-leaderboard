Christopher Nolan was born in 1970.\n\nAmong the globally significant historical events in 1970, the **First Earth Day**, held on **April 22, 1970**, stands out as having substantial worldwide impact within its calendar year.\n\n**Event**: First Earth Day  \n**Date**: April 22, 1970  \n**Significance**: Approximately 20 million Americans participated in environmental protests, marking the birth of the modern environmental movement. This event led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the passage of landmark environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. Its impact was not only national but also inspired global environmental awareness and activism, laying the foundation for future international environmental policies.\n\nThus, the globally significant historical event during $x$'s birth year with verifiable substantial worldwide impact is the **First Earth Day**.",

They were Orville Wright (1871\u20131948) and Wilbur Wright (1867\u20131912). On December 17, 1903, they made the first controlled, sustained, powered flight in a heavier-than-air machine near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This historic flight marked the beginning of modern aviation.\n\nThe brothers developed a three-axis control system that allowed pilots to steer the aircraft effectively and maintain balance\u2014fundamental principles still used in aviation today.
